					      	<p>This aspect of the United States Experience Practice Activity focuses on the Native people whose land on which my hometown of San Mateo, California is located. Throughout this phase of the assignment, I've been thinking: is my hometown <em>really</em> my hometown? Or is it someone else's? Of course, I consider San Mateo and the rest of the San Francisco Peninsula to be my one and only home&mdash;it's where I've spent my entire life; however, long before the suburban neighborhoods and downtown districts of the Peninsula, the Ramaytush Ohlone people inhabited the beautiful oceanside and bayside lands (Association of Ramaytush Ohlone).</p>
					      	<h2 id="discoveries">My Discoveries</h2>
					      	<div class="image-text">
								  <img class="image-text" id="map-image" src="./../assets/images/map.png">
							      <p class="image-text">To the left is a photo of map of the various tribes of the Ramaytush Ohlone people on the San Francisco Peninsula from the official Association of Ramaytush Ohlone website. My house in San Mateo is located on the land of the Ssalson tribelet, the third tribe down from the top on the right side. One of the other places I spend a lot of my time in San Mateo County is the city of Pacifica, the location of the Aramai tribelet (Urich). Learning that some of my favorite places, locations, monuments, and natural lands in San Mateo County have so much history behind them is incredible to me, but it also highlights how little I know about my homeland.</p>
							</div>
					      	<h3 id="overview" style="margin-bottom: 0;">Overview of the Ramaytush Oblone people</h3>
					      	<p>According to the Association of Ramaytush Ohlone's official website, there were around 1,400 Ramaytush people living throughout the Peninsula before the arrival of the Spanish conquerers. The association confers with the map and claims that "[the Ramaytush people] were divided into ten independent tribelets, including the Aramai that was situated...in and around present-day Pacifica." Additionally, the site states that most people who originate from Ramaytush origin today usually refer to themselves as Ohlone rather than Ramaytush or Ramaytush Ohlone.</p>
					      	<p>Since the arrival of the Spanish in 1769, the tribes and families of the Ramaytush people were involved in the various missions throughout the Bay Area, including Missions Dolores, Santa Clara, San José, San Rafael, and San Francisco Solano (Association of Ramaytush Ohlone).</p>
					      	<h3 id="interesting" style="margin-bottom: 0;">Interesting findings</h3>
					      	<ul>
					      		<li>According to their website, the Ramaytush are "the only known living descendants of the aboriginal peoples" on the Peninsula.</li>
					      		<li>Ramaytush Ohlone people have been in the Bay Area since as early as 4000 BCE (Urich).</li>
					      		<li>After the Spanish colonization of the area and relocation of the Ramaytush Ohlone to their missions, only a few families out of thousands of people survived.</li>
					      	</ul>
					      	<h3 id="relations">Current relations</h3>
					      	<div class="image-text">
								  <img class="image-text" id="map-image" src="./../assets/images/tule-canoe.jpg">
							      <p class="image-text">The Association of Ramaytush Ohlone's website has an informative and up-to-date exploration of their current position on the Peninsula, in the county, in the state, and the nation. Although, in their words, "only one lineage is [known] to have produced living descendants in the present [day]," the Association has numerous updates on their position in the Bay Area as well as in the state.</p>
							</div>
							<p>For example, according to their site, one of their most recent initiatives has been to work towards the removal of the Father Junipero Serra statue located along Interstate 280 (Association of Ramaytush Ohlone), a freeway that's named after the priest, and now, saint. The Association's site claims that CalTrans has done nothing to remove the statue, which is disappointing for the Ramaytush people.</p>
							<div class="image-text">
								  <img class="image-text" id="map-image" src="./../assets/images/serra.jpg">
							      <p class="image-text">This statue and the overall celebration and respect for St. Serra has been a major controversy for Native Americans living on the Peninsula recently. Back in 2015 when Junipero Serra was officially canonized by Pope Francis, many Native Americans, including local Ramaytush people, criticized the Pope's actions. Unfortunately, the Archbishop of the San Francisco Archdiocese, who is known to be majorly sexist, homophobic, heterosexist, and racist, has claimed that he understands Native Americans' issue with Serra's presence in California, but questions, "Were the indigenous people better off with the missionaries or without the missionaries? I would say they were better off with the missionaries" (Pogash). In 2016, the Arcbbishop continued to assert that Native American people were subhuman and that "discovery" was inevitable, so there's no problem with Serra's canonization.</p>
							</div>
							<p>Besides their efforts to work with the County of San Mateo and State of California to remove a statue of someone that contributed to the deaths of their ancestors, the Ramaytush people have also worked towards regaining some of their original lands. According to their site, "from a Native perspective, no one really owns land." They have worked towards gaining land trusts for various areas on the Peninsula, like at Filoli House and Gardens and Black Point. Additionally, the Ramaytush Ohlone have plans to incorporate an American Indian garden in a storage space of Golden Gate Park in San Francisco.</p>
							<p>The Ramaytush Ohlone people have also worked towards museum exhibits, communtiy events, and art projects to remind Bay Area residents of the history and culture rooted in the lands. Clearly, their efforts have worked to spread American Indian culture and voices throughout the Bay Area, but the Association continues to face challenges from local, county, and state institutions.</p>
					      	<h3 id="reflection" style="margin-bottom: 0;">My reflection</h3>
					      	<p>Learning about the Ramaytush Ohlone Native Americans who inhabited the San Francisco Peninsula has given me a richer understanding of my relationship to my hometown. I have always been invested in San Mateo County history, but none of my explorations of the county's stories have ever included the Ramaytush people. Learning about their past presence and continued efforts on the Peninsula reminds me that while I have a special connection to San Mateo, generations of Native people for thousands of years have maintained a deep link with the Peninsula.</p>
					      	<p>When I used to commute to school everyday on the Junipero Serra Freeeway, I noticed the statue of St. Serra pointing out at me as I drove, but I never questioned the story behind its origins or what it explains about the history of San Mateo County. Now, when I return home and drive by the statue, I know I'll think of the Ramaytush people and their connection to this land as well as the brutality and abuse they suffered as a part of Serra's mission program. I have a lot more to consider as I call my San Mateo house my home&mdash;because I now know that my home is also someone else's.</p>
